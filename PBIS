                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-slate-700 strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>Morning Meetings:</strong> Daily gatherings that build community, allow students to practice social skills, and set a positive tone for the day. They often include greetings, sharing, group activities, and news/announcements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Schedules:</strong> Displayed timetables or sequences of activities that help students understand routines, predict transitions, and manage their time. They are particularly helpful for students who benefit from clear structure and predictability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive Reinforcement Systems (e.g., Token Economy):</strong> Systems where students earn tokens, points, or other rewards for demonstrating desired behaviors. These can often be exchanged for preferred items or activities, motivating positive conduct.</li>
                    <li><strong>Short and Engaging Activities:</strong> Brief, interactive tasks or learning segments designed to maintain student focus and participation. These can be used as transitions, brain breaks, or to introduce new concepts in a lively way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Classroom Jobs:</strong> Assigned responsibilities that give students a sense of ownership and contribution to the classroom community. These roles teach responsibility, teamwork, and practical skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement Breaks:</strong> Short periods of physical activity incorporated into the school day to help students refocus, release energy, and improve concentration. They can be structured exercises or simple stretches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice Boards:</strong> Tools that offer students a selection of tasks or activities to choose from, promoting autonomy and engagement. They can be used for practice, enrichment, or demonstrating understanding in varied ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Activities:</strong> Learning tasks that require students to work together in pairs or small groups to achieve a common goal. These activities foster teamwork, communication, and social skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conflict Resolution Instruction:</strong> Teaching students specific strategies and skills to manage disagreements peacefully and respectfully. This often involves learning to identify problems, listen to others, and brainstorm solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Regulation Tools/Instruction:</strong> Providing students with strategies and tools (like calm-down corners, breathing exercises) to manage their emotions, impulses, and behaviors effectively. Direct instruction helps students learn to recognize their feelings and choose appropriate responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Goal Setting:</strong> Guiding students to identify academic or behavioral targets and create plans to achieve them. This process helps develop motivation, self-awareness, and a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible Seating:</strong> Offering various seating options in the classroom that allow students to choose a learning environment that best suits their needs. This can improve comfort, focus, and engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teaching School-Wide Expectations (Behavior Matrix):</strong> Clearly defining, teaching, and displaying 3-5 positive behavioral expectations across all school settings. A matrix often outlines what these expectations look like in different locations (e.g., "Be Respectful," "Be Responsible," "Be Safe").</li>
                    <li><strong>Active Supervision:</strong> Staff members systematically monitoring students by moving, scanning, and interacting positively in various school environments. This proactive approach helps prevent problem behaviors and encourage positive ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Skills Instruction:</strong> Explicitly teaching students appropriate social behaviors, communication skills, and interpersonal problem-solving. Lessons often involve modeling, role-playing, and feedback in a structured manner.</li>

                    <li><strong>Check-In/Check-Out (CICO):</strong> A program where students meet with a mentor at the start and end of the day to review behavioral goals and receive feedback. Teachers provide ratings on a daily progress report, fostering positive adult connections and accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small Group Social-Emotional Learning:</strong> Targeted instruction for small groups of students focusing on specific social skills, emotional regulation, or problem-solving techniques. These groups provide a supportive environment for skill practice and development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior Contracts:</strong> Written agreements between a student, teacher(s), and often parents, outlining specific behavioral goals and the rewards or consequences associated with meeting them. They provide clarity and shared understanding of expectations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring Programs:</strong> Pairing students with positive adult or peer role models who provide guidance, support, and encouragement. Mentoring can help improve school engagement, social skills, and self-esteem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forced Choice Reinforcement Surveys:</strong> Assessment tools used to identify effective reinforcers for a student by having them choose between various preferred items or activities. This helps tailor motivation strategies to individual preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Stories:</strong> Short, individualized narratives that describe social situations, skills, or concepts to help students understand social cues, expectations, and appropriate responses. They are often used for students with autism or social communication difficulties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structured Breaks:</strong> Predetermined, scheduled breaks from academic tasks or demanding situations, designed to help students manage stress or refocus. These breaks are often short and have a clear purpose and routine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Academic Supports:</strong> Providing specific instructional strategies, accommodations, or interventions to help students overcome academic skill deficits that may contribute to behavioral challenges. This can include focused small group instruction or modified assignments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Self-Management Strategies:</strong> Teaching students to monitor their own behavior, set goals, and apply strategies to achieve those goals. This empowers students to take responsibility for their actions and make positive changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Counseling Referrals (brief interventions):</strong> Connecting students with school counselors or mental health professionals for short-term, solution-focused support to address specific emotional or behavioral concerns. This is for students needing more than universal support but not intensive therapy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternatives to Suspension (restorative practices):</strong> Approaches that focus on repairing harm and rebuilding relationships rather than solely relying on punitive measures. Examples include restorative circles, mediation, and community service related to the behavior.</li>

                    <p>Transition to Tier 3 if behavior persists despite 6-8 weeks of Tier 2 support, poses safety risks, significantly disrupts learning, or Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) data indicates a need for personalized interventions.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-slate-700 strategy-list">
                    <li><strong>Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA):</strong> A systematic process of gathering information to understand the purpose or function (the "why") a student engages in a specific challenging behavior. This involves interviews, observations, and data analysis to identify antecedents and consequences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP):</strong> A comprehensive, individualized plan developed from FBA results that outlines strategies to prevent problem behaviors, teach replacement skills, and reinforce positive behaviors. It also details how to respond if the problem behavior occurs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Individual & Visual Schedules (highly customized):</strong> Tailored visual supports that break down a student's day, tasks, or routines into manageable steps, often with specific times or cues. These are more detailed and personalized than Tier 1 visual schedules to meet significant individual needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensory Tools and Strategies:</strong> Providing specific tools (e.g., fidgets, weighted vests, noise-canceling headphones) or environmental modifications to help students manage sensory input and regulate their arousal levels. These are based on individual sensory needs identified through assessment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration with Physicians/Mental Health Providers:</strong> Working closely with a student's external medical or mental health professionals to coordinate care, share information (with consent), and align strategies. This ensures a holistic approach to support.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wraparound Services:</strong> A comprehensive, team-based planning process that brings together multiple systems (e.g., school, family, community agencies) to create a highly individualized support plan for students with complex needs. The focus is on leveraging collective strengths and resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approaches:</strong> Therapeutic techniques that help students identify and change unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors. In a school setting, this might involve teaching coping skills, problem-solving, and emotional regulation, often by trained personnel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intensive Social Skills Training:</strong> Highly focused and individualized instruction on specific social skills a student struggles with, often involving direct teaching, modeling, repeated practice, and feedback in real-life situations. This goes beyond general social skills lessons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crisis Prevention and Response Planning:</strong> Developing a proactive plan to identify triggers for severe behavioral episodes, implement prevention strategies, and outline clear, safe procedures for responding if a crisis occurs. This plan is individualized for students with high-risk behaviors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Skill Training (teaching replacement behaviors):</strong> Explicitly teaching and reinforcing appropriate alternative behaviors that serve the same function as the student's challenging behavior. For example, teaching a student to ask for a break instead of eloping.</li>
                    <li><strong>One-on-one aide or specialist support:</strong> Assigning a dedicated paraprofessional or behavior specialist to provide direct, intensive support to a student, focusing on implementing the BIP and helping the student access learning. This is for students with the most significant needs.</li>
